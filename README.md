BetCenter is a project made with React to display advanced data for each day's sports matchups. Currently NBA is in development.

Using various APIs to collect the data.

Plan:
  - React for frontend
  - Node for backend
  - Take advantage of AWS services to achieve scalability, including ElastiCache (Redis), APIGateway, EC2, etc.
  - Home page shows a table of today's NBA matchups, and when you click one it brings user to a page shows further data about the matchup
  - Can cache the data from these pages to reduce API calls to other servers

Data planning to include: 
  - Season series so far between the teams
  - Record of last 10 games between the teams
  - Each teams last 10 games record
  - Each teams rankings in statistical categories like rebounds, 3PM, assists, etc and defensive stats
  - How top players have performed against their matchup last 5 games (player x has averages y pts, z rebounds etc in last 5 games against team A)
  - Injuries in the matchup
  - Current betting lines
  - How each team has performed with certain odds (when team X is a -200 i.e. heavy favourite, theyre 3-6 this season for example)
